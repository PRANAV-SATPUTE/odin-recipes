<p>     Pani puri is an immensely popular Indian street food of crispy, hollow,<br> fried dough balls (puri) stuffed with boiled potatoes or steamed <br>moong sprouts or boiled chickpeas or white peas curry (also known as <br>ragda) together with spicy tangy water and a sweet chutney. Pani puri<br> is a favorite chaat snack of many folks and ours too. With so many <br>bursts of tastes and flavors in your mouth when you have pani puri, <br>you just cannot have one ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>     Pani Literally translates to water and here the Puris are<br> fried puffed crisp dough balls which are hollow.<br> Generally, the water or pani is sour, tangy as well as spicy. <br>This spicy pani is balanced with the addition of sweet tamarind chutney.


<br>This sweet chutney is called as Meetha (which means sweet) Pani.<br> The spicy water is called as Teekha (which means spicy) Pani.<br> Both are added in the puri along with the main filling<br> which consists of boiled potatoes, cooked chickpeas, moong sprouts or <br>a thick dry curry made from white peas which is called as Ragda.</p>
<p>Pani puri is my most favorite chaat from childhood. I used to have them often with my <br>family on the streets of Mumbai (Bombay) and it was something I have thoroughly <br>enjoyed.</p>
